        <p style ="text-align: center; color: #C133FF;"> Most of the borders of Bangladesh are surrounded by India. Bangladesh became independent from the ruler Pakistan in 1971 through a bloodshed war of 9 months where almost 3 million people were killed brutally. After this liberation war, Bangladesh gained its independence.

These problems are stopping its prosperity and development towards a smart Bangladesh. The Sheikh Hasina government is trying its best to reduce these problems. Problems like corruption, illiteracy, environmental pollution, traffic jams, scams, and disputes always prevent its prosperity. People live miserable lives here.

Every day they have a new problem in their lives. Though Bangladesh has so many problems, It is going to be a peaceful country to live in soon. Bangladeshis are very brave, they are overcoming these problems day by day.
